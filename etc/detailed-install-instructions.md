## Detailed install instructions

First, try:

```bash
pip3 install pheweb
```

If that command fails, then:

- If you have root access, run:

  ```bash
  sudo pip3 install pheweb
  ```

  If you're not sure whether you have root access, just try it.
  If you don't have root access it will say something like `you are not in the sudoers file.`


- Otherwise, I recommend using miniconda3 to install pheweb.

  To install miniconda3,

  - if you're on macOS, run:

    ```bash
    curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh > install-miniconda3.sh
    bash install-miniconda3.sh
    ```

  - if you're on Linux, run:

    ```bash
    curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh > install-miniconda3.sh
    bash install-miniconda3.sh
    ```

  Type &lt;enter&gt; to view the terms & conditions.  When you're done with them, type "q" to close them, and then "yes" &lt;enter&gt; to accept them.

  Type &lt;enter&gt; to agree to the path `~/miniconda3`.

  Type "yes" and &lt;enter&gt; to let have miniconda modify `$PATH` in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`.

  Miniconda3 makes `python` an alias for `python3` and `pip` an alias for `pip3`.  That's likely to cause problems, so I recommend running:

  ```bash
  rm ~/miniconda3/bin/python
  rm ~/miniconda3/bin/pip
  ```

  Next, close and re-open your terminal (to make the new changes take effect) and then run:

  ```bash
  pip3 install pheweb
  ```
