### Issues during import

    The WDL was not the current import.wdl, and there were issues related to generating gene pa


## import production

    *Import*

	*Configuration*
    2275 endpoints, including 2269 binary endpoints and 6 quantitative endpoints. 3 of these quantitative endpoints ( HEIGHT, WEIGHT, BMI) were not intended as core analysis endpoints.

    See r9.production.import.json

### Issues when running import
    *Incident*
    in annotation task, `pheweb make-gene-aliases-sqlite3` failed due to a file download failing. Rerunning the task solved the problem.

    *Solution*
    Transient error -> rerun did not encounter it.

    *Incident*
    Copying of files to GCS failed for annotation task.
    Error message: ServiceException: 401 Anonymous caller does not have storage.objects.list access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    *Solution*
    Disabling of file copying  and subsequent manual copying to GCS.

## empty best phenos by gene

	*Incident*

	The bed file contained an entry with 'M' as a chromsome.
	The causes best-phenos-by-gene to fail writing out an
	empty json object.

	The bed script was updated to filter out 'M' chromsomes.

## missing genes, invalid chromosomes

  *incident*
  Pheweb was using an old version of the gene region file (genes-b38-v37.bed), which resulted in https://r9.finngen.fi/gene/MRPL45P2 failing.

  *primary solution*
  First solution was to replace genes-b38-v37.bed with the v39 bed file from gs://r9_data_green/genes-b38-v39.bed.
  However, the file contained genes in chromosome M, which caused an error in chromosome name assertion in function utils.get_gene_tuples() (https://github.com/FINNGEN/pheweb/blob/master/pheweb/utils.py#L157).

  *Secondary solution*
  This was fixed by filtering out chromosome M genes from the region file:
  ```
  grep -vE "^M" genes-b38-v39.bed genes-b38-v37.bed
  ```
  *Notes*
  Hardcoded gene file names are quite fragile, moving gene file to be read from config could be beneficial. And/or allowing the filename to reflect the file version.
  Error propagation with more information in https://github.com/FINNGEN/pheweb/blob/master/pheweb/serve/server.py#L372-L412 could help initial investigation.

## Search autocomplete not working

  *incident*
  Search bar autocomplete did not work. Investigation revealed that files were copied to pheweb-folder/generated-by-pheweb/resources and pheweb-folder/generated-by-pheweb/sites, whereas pheweb looked for them in pheweb-folder/resources and pheweb-folder/sites.

### Meta analysis columns are out of order

	*incident*

	https://github.com/FINNGEN/pheweb/issues/242

	The meta analysis browsers had columns that were swapped.

	This is due to a bug in the import step 'agument-phenos'.
	The summary statistics were reimported
